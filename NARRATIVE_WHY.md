## ✨ What It Fixes: Solving Real-World Creator Challenges

Many talented individuals struggle for visibility and fair compensation. Traditional platforms can be overcrowded, algorithmically opaque, and impose high fees. Furthermore, creators, especially in regions underserved by traditional finance, face hurdles with payment processing, chargebacks, and platform de-platforming. The current Web3 landscape, while powerful, often intimidates both creators and users with complex wallet management and transaction processes. OnlyFrens tackles these issues head-on:

This virtually eliminates the need for users to manage complex crypto wallets or browser extensions for most interactions.
*   **🌍 Global Financial Inclusion:** Stellar's payment rails are inherently global and permissionless.
