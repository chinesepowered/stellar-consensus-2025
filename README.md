# OnlyFrens - Uplifting Creators with Stellar

## The Narrative "Why"

OnlyFrens is a platform built to support and uplift creators, focusing on individuals like street vendors, artists, and educators who are making a positive impact. It provides a space for creators to share their stories and for users to support them through subscriptions, tips, and the purchase of exclusive content (NFTs).

-   **What it fixes:** Addresses the challenge creators face in monetizing their work and reaching a supportive audience, especially those outside the mainstream.
-   **Who it's helping:** Creators from diverse backgrounds, particularly those in need of a platform to showcase their talents and secure financial support. Users who want to directly support creators they believe in.
-   **Why it's important:** Empowers creators, fosters a direct connection between creators and supporters, and promotes a culture of appreciation for diverse talents and stories.
-   **Value Proposition:** A transparent and empowering platform for creators to thrive and for users to make a meaningful impact through their support, leveraging the speed and low cost of the Stellar network and the security of passkeys.
